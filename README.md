* [Live site](), https://alphairus.github.io/legion-client/
* A back-end API, built with Ruby on Rails

### Planning
1/6-1/8
Tested out my user_routes with curl scripts to confirm their behavior. After being able to confirm, I created a legion model and worked towards my legion_routes. I tested out my venue routes to confirm their behavior, as well.

1/11 Deployed to Heroku

1/23-24 - updated scripts and assets to match front-end

### Unfinished

Will like to add a other aspects and options to the database.
